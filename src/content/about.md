Hey there! My name is Vlad Albert and I'm a full stack web developer and UI/UX enthusiast.

I'm a problem solver and a big picture thinker. This makes me very passionate about building apps with vital and/or innovative functionality for end users.

What I enjoy most is bringing ideas into reality and the whole creative process behind it (from *designing databases* to *CSS animations* and everything inbetween).
