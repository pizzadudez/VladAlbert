Hey there! My name is Vlad Albert, I'm a full stack web developer and UI/UX enthusiast.

I'm very passionate about building robust apps, with practical and innovative functionalities for the end users. At the core I'm a problem solver and a big picture thinker. 

What I enjoy most is bringing ideas into reality and the whole creative process behind it (from *designing databases* to *CSS animations* and everything inbetween).
